        The :class:`~Protein_Folding.protein_folding_problem.ProteinFoldingProblem`
        uses a compressed optimization problem that does not match the
        number of qubits in the original objective function. This method calculates the original
        version of the solution vector. Bits that can take any value without changing the
        solution are denoted by '_'.
        This string is read from right to left, and every pair of bits encodes a turn ranging from 0
        to 4:

        * The first 4 correspond to the first 2 turns in the sequence. These 2 turns can arbitrarily
          be set to any value due to rotation symmetry. Therefore the first 4 bits will be unused.

        * If there is no secondary chain going out from the 2nd bead in the main chain, another
          symmetry argument makes it such that the 3rd turn has effectively only 2 options.
          Therefore the 5th qubit can sometimes be unused as well.

        * The remaining pairs of qubits will encode the remaining turns of the main bead and then
          the turns of the secondary chains in that order.

        Example: In the context of a protein of length 5 with secondary chains in the 2nd and 4th
        position ``10110110`` encodes the most efficient configuration. We start by flipping the
        string and pairing up the bits ``01-10-11-01``. Note that in this case we have an even
        number of bits. This is only due to the fact that we have a secondary chain in the second
        position. Since the first 2 turns on the main chain were arbitrarily set (In qiskit we
        chose to set them to ``[1,0]`` respectively) the sequence of turns in the main chain is
        ``[0,1,1,2]``. The remaining pairs of bits indicate that the turns from the secondary
        chains in the 2nd and 4th position are ``3`` and ``1`` respectively.
